This is a set of scripts for printing a TaskPaper document onto a letter-sized sheet of paper that will then be cut down to 6x8 for inserting into a "Junior size" Circa/Rolla planner. The tasks are laid out in a nice two-column format with enough room on the right edge for binding.

You print this by running the "Planner print" AppleScript. There are lots of ways to do this. You run it from [the global Script menu][8]; or you can run it through third-party systems like [FastScripts][4], [LaunchBar][5], [Keyboard Maestro][6], [Alfred][7], or others that I can't think of right now.

In addition to the scripts in this repository, you'll need:

1. A [Markdown][1] processor. I use Fletcher Penney's [MultiMarkdown][3].
2. The `ps2pdf` utility that comes with [Ghostscript][2].

Before running the `install.sh` script, you'll need to:

1. Edit `tp2html` to set the path to your Markdown processor.
2. Edit `html2planner` to set the path to `ps2pdf`.

Depending on your workflow, you may also want to edit `html2planner` to have it send the generated document straight to the printer instead of Preview. The comments in `html2planner` will tell you how to do that.
